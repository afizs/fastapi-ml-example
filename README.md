# fastapi-ml-example
Simple example for deploying ML model with FastAPI. In this example I have used GuassianNB as our model and iris dataset to train our model. 

## Run the code
`uvicorn main:app --reload` 
`FastAPI` runs on `port:8000` by default. To access the docs, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/
